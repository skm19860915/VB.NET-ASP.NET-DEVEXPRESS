                        <b>Privacy.</b> The Klemantaski Collection values the trust our
                        customers place in us. Respecting privacy and confidentiality is
                        vital to maintaining that trust.

                    <p>
                        In the course of serving our customers, we may collect and
                        retain certain non-public personal and financial information. The
                        Klemantaski Collection does not disclose any non-public
                        information about you without your permission, except to
                        service providers such as credit card processors, or as may be
                        required by law.

                    <p>
                        <b>Security.</b> To help ensure that any information you provide to us
                        will not be disclosed inappropriately, we maintain physical,
                        electronic and procedural safeguards. Our web site uses an SSL
                        Certificate while prompting the user for their personal and credit
                        card information. That information is stored in the server's
                        secure directory. We then receive an email stating that an order
                        has been received. None of your secure information is
                        transmitted via email. We then access the secure server and
                        obtain your information which is then erased from the server.
                        Also, we do not keep any credit card information on our systems
                        after processing your order.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you have any questions about the confidentiality and security
                        of your personal and financial information, please feel free to
                        contact us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Refunds.</b> Any photographic print or book purchased through
                        our website or otherwise, except for Custom Orders, may be
                        returned for either credit or refund (including our shipping
                        charges) within 30 days of receipt, provided that any such item
                        is returned at your expense in its original packaging and insured
                        for its full retail value. Custom Orders include prints on paper
                        larger than 16x20 inches or orders containing prints on paper
                        smaller than 16x20 inches with a total order value in excess of
                        $1,500. Custom Orders are not returnable for credit or refund.
