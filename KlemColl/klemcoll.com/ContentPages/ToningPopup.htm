<h1>What is Toning?</h1>
<p>We now have the ability to offer toning
for b&w prints which gives the print a
somewhat “warmer” visual impression
than a standard neutral gray image. Some
people might refer to this as being a very
slight sepia tone.</p>
<p>Some of our customers prefer this toning
for older b&w images as it gives the print
a more antique visual feeling.</p>
