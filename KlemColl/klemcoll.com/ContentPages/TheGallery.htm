                    The Gallery contains over three thousand photographs from our archives. We suggest you use
                    the filters set out below to make a selection. If you do not indicate a preference
                    within at least one of these categories, the number of images which will have to
                    load may take inordinately long. In some instances we have given you the option
                    of making two selections within a category. If you wish to know more about ordering
                    prints, prices and shipping costs, please click here on <a href="Downloads.aspx">

                    The images in The Gallery represent those that are particular favorites of both
                    our photographers and many collectors. However, they still represent only a very
                    small sample of what we have available.
