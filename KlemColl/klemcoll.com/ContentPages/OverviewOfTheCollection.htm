                                over 600,000 motor racing and related automotive photographs and is one of the
                                largest and most varied libraries of its kind anywhere in the world. The
                                Collection is based on three major archives. The first includes all of the motor
                                racing images taken by the famous photographer Louis Klemantaski during his
                                long and active career from 1936-1974. There are some 60,000 Klemantaski images
                                in the Collection. Most of these are black and white, but there are a
                                significant number of photos in color, including some from the prewar Grand
                                Prix events.
